            <h1>Horse Racing Simulator</h1>

            <h3>How To Play?</h3>
            
            <p>There will be 8 stat cards at the bottom of the screen, these are the horses each with randomly generated stats.
                They show the horses speed and endurance. Use these stats to choose your bet, but be careful, the fastest horse doesnt always win.
                Click the horse card in order to add it to your bet. Once satisfied, hit "place bet" to start the race!
            </p>
            <h3>Types of bets</h3>
            <p>The order in which you click the horse cards is the order you expect the horses to come in. The first horse you click must take first, 
                the second must take second and the third must take third and so on. If you do not like the order you chose, click reset.
            </p>
            <h3>Box Button?</h3>
            <p>What does the box button do? When clicking the button the costs of your bet go up, but it allows you to win regardless of hourse order.
                If you choose horse 3 and then horse 4. they can come in either order.
            </p>
            <h3>Payout?</h3>
            <p>The payout is calculated based on the horses changes to win, the fast strong horses obviously dont payout nearly as much as a long shot. Longshots do and will win from time to time!</p>
